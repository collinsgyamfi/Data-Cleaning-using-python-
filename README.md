# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with students dataset for beginners and  advanced

## What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental step in the data science process, enabling data scientists to analyze and investigate datasets to summarize their key characteristics, often utilizing data visualization techniques.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing EDA on a telecom dataset using Python's Pandas library. The goal is to clean, prepare, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights.

## Steps Involved in the EDA Process

### Step 0: Imports and Loading Dataset
In this step, we will import the necessary libraries and load the telecom dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns



This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of EDA using telecom data. By following the outlined steps, you will gain insights into data cleaning, preparation, and analysis, setting a strong foundation for further data analysis and modeling.
#Step 1: Data Understanding
In this step, we will perform a series of checks to understand the structure and content of the telecom dataset:

- **DataFrame Shape**: Determine the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
  ```python
  print("DataFrame Shape:", data.shape)

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:


data = pd.read_csv('telecom_data.csv')  # Replace with your dataset path
